# Library
Creation of an online library website.
I created this site with html and css entirely, then I added php connect to the database.
The site contains only DIV, which form several paragraphs where you can navigate easily with a scroll.
The DIV contain two forms, one to add a book and another to change the availability of the book. Books appears in the first DIV
